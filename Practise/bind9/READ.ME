To set up a dns server make a next steps:
===
sudo -i
cd /etc
mv resolf.conf resolv.conf.old
echo "nameserver [your dns server ip], for example 127.0.0.1 or another" > resolf.conf
chattr +i resolv.conf - make a file to unchangeble
rm resolv.conf - check chattr
===

a service:
sudo systemctl status systemd-resolved.service - stop and disable, to work with own dns server
